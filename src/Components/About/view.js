      Greetings, Subash Pradhan 29 originally from Nepal
      and currently living with in Haarlem, Netherlands.
      A recent graduate from Codaisseur
      seeking my next opportunities to
      develop my career in Web Development and add
      value to the project that I am
      lucky enough to join. As mentioned,
      I am Originally came Netherlands to achieve
      Automotive Engineering as Bachelors
      before finding my true passion.
      Involving myself in small projects with web design,
      I was impressed immediately infatuated with the way coding
      worked. As my infatuation grew in Web designing and wanting to
      know more about developing websites along with coding,
      I landed on NYCDA (New York Code & Design Academy) to
      learn basic of web Development.
      After initially completing the course incredibly
      successful achieving web development basics,
      I got ill with TB which rendered my house bound for nearly
      6 months. As you can imagine this was a major setback for me
      professionally and personally as I am also a
      keen athlete regularly pushing myself to extremes including
      Gurkha academy, British army and foreign legion special
      forces training which covered numerous years. Once
      recovered however health wise and financially I decided
      to join Bootcamp at Codaisseur to continue my
      career path in development where I was
      able to craft my skills on advance new technologies as HTML5,
      CSS3, JavaScript, React, Redux, Vue, Vuetify, SQL, Node.js,
      Express.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Heroku, GraphQl, Typescript,
      Git, Github and more innovative technologies to make myself as a
      Full Stack Developer.
      Evidently, I am an enthusiastic, determined,
      consciousness, motivated developer
      who is adaptable, compatible and lives for new challenges.
      I make it my mission to keep up to date with modern technologies
      and be aware of cutting-edge innovations which I feel
      is where the value comes in. You can definitely consider me as
      a key team player who is always resourceful and is focused to
      add value on every project. Hard work and determination have always been
      my key to success and I hope to be able to bring this to
      those I am able to work with.
